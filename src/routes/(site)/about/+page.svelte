		Mike and I have been friends since our early days in first grade. Our first encounter took place
		in the cafeteria, where I noticed Mike standing in the lunch line. Intrigued, I approached him
		and inquired, "Why do you have so many cuts on your leg?" Mike explained that they were the
		result of his adventurous bike rides and outdoor play. As time went on, our bond grew stronger
		in fifth grade while collaborating on a community day project. Gradually, feelings of mutual
		attraction began to develop between us. Although Mike had planned to ask me to the fifth-grade
		dance, I had already made other arrangements, which left him disappointed. Throughout middle
		school and the beginning of high school, we drifted apart as we mingled with different friend
		groups.

		However, our paths intersected again during our ninth-grade gym class. One day, Mike invited me
		to play tennis with him, and without hesitation, I accepted. We cherished the moments of
		laughter and camaraderie shared in the gym. It was during this time that our teacher repeatedly
		expressed her belief that Mike harbored feelings for me. Despite her insistence, I remained
		skeptical until that summer vacation when Mike reached out to me through Instagram's direct
		messages. We started conversing and hung out a few times before he surprised me by asking me to
		be his girlfriend at the mini-golf course. It was an incredibly sweet gesture that touched my
		heart. Thus, our relationship officially commenced at the beginning of tenth grade, and our love
		has only grown stronger since then.

		Together, we have faced numerous challenges and experienced both joyous and tumultuous times
		throughout our nearly six years of dating. Yet, we wouldn't trade our journey for anything else.
		The prospect of spending a lifetime together fills us with overwhelming excitement and
		happiness.

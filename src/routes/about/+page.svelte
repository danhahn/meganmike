	<h2>Mike</h2>
	<p>
		I still remember the day I met Megan in high school like it was yesterday. We were just friends
		at first, but as we talked more and more, I realized that she was the one I wanted to spend the
		rest of my life with. When COVID hit and the world turned upside down, our friendship grew even
		stronger, and I finally mustered up the courage to tell her how I truly felt. To my surprise,
		she felt the same way and we started a long-distance relationship.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the distance, our love for each other only grew stronger, and I knew I wanted to spend
		the rest of my life with her. So, during one of my deployments, I surprised her with a proposal
		and she said yes. Now, I can't wait to marry the love of my life and start our lives together.

	<h2>Megan</h2>
	<p>
		I never would have thought that a chance meeting in high school would lead to the love of my
		life. But from the moment I started talking to Mike, I knew he was someone special. Our
		friendship only grew stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic, and when he told me how he felt, I
		was overjoyed to realize that I felt the same way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our long-distance relationship was not easy, but it only made our love stronger. I never thought
		I'd find someone who could understand and support me through anything, but Mike proved me wrong.
		So, when he surprised me with a proposal during one of his deployments, I knew without a doubt
		that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I can't wait to marry my best friend and
		soulmate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are so grateful to have found each other and can't wait to start our lives together as
		husband and wife. Thank you for joining us on this journey.
